= Codename One WebRTC Library

A https://webrtc.github.io/[WebRTC] implementation for https://www.codenameone.com[Codename One].

== Project Status

Under development.  See https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/3226[this issue] to follow the progress.

The WebRTC API includes nearly 100 classes.  This project aims to provide Codename One (Java/Kotlin) implementations for all APIs.   The general process that we are that we are taking is as follows:

1. Create Java interfaces for all WebRTC interfaces.  **Complete**
2. Port https://webrtc.github.io/samples/[WebRTC samples] one by one, implementing functionalities required for the samples to work, and fixing bugs as they appear.  **In progress**

**So far we have ported the following samples:**

. https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/getusermedia/gum/[Basic getUserMedia demo].  https://github.com/shannah/CN1WebRTC/blob/master/src/com/codename1/webrtc/demos/BasicDemo.java[View Ported Source]
